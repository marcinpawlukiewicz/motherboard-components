# The Computer Memory
The computer memory is called Random Access Memory, often its more popular name is RAM. Those are chips that temporarily store dynamic data, for example, our open applications, desktop, some background application. This allows us to have a quick access to the application and once we leave them for a second we can easily go back. The same is when we want to use more than one application at the same time. Partially, this is possible because of RAM.

In other words, RAM is kind of like a bridge between hard drive and the processor. It holds certain dynamic data so when processor needs it, it doesnâ€™t have to go all the way back to the hard drive. Once the computer is shut down, the RAM is freed. Proper shutting down of our computer secures RAM data as they can return to the hard drive safely[^1]. 

Before RAM is fully functional after turning the computer on those are few processes that are happening during the start of the system. Firstly, the computer loads read only data (ROM) and makes some tests to make sure that all the hardware is fully functional (power-on self-test, POST). Next, the computer loads basic input/output system (BIOS) that provides to the computer possibility of using basic functions and recognize additional devices. Then the computer loads operating system such as Windows, Linux, macOS etc. This goes straight from the hard drive into RAM that is why we can see so many processes in the background if we turn on the activity monitor. Now, as RAM received OS it knows it job and what from the system should kept for fast information processing[^2].
