# The Computer Chip-sets

A chipset is a set of electronic components, a group of small circuits, that coordinate the data flow. It is responsible for the communication between all main components such as a processor, RAM or input/output. The Chipset's crucial role is to maintain communication between the processor and the rest of the elements on the motherboard[^1]. 

Usually, a computer contains two main chipsets. One of them is called the NorthBridge and it controls transfer between the processor and the RAM. This is also the reason why it is placed nearby the processor. The other one is called the SouthBridge and this one is responsible for the control of input/output as well as the expansion buses[^2].
