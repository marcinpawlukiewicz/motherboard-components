# Major Motherboard Components and Their Functions

The purpose of this project is to understand and describe major components of the motherboard. Thus, I selected the following elements to be described as I believe those are the most important components and without them, the computer would not be able to function as it does today.

- The Computer's Microprocessor
- The Computer Memory
- BIOS (basic input/output system)
- The CMOS Battery
- The Computer Cache Memory
- The Expansion Buses
- The Computer Chip-sets
- The CPU Clock

This comparison gives me better understanding and a different perspective of the processes that play very important roles in programming. I believe that physical understanding of the computer is equally important as software knowledge and so I wanted to explore this part of the CS.
